<<if visited("GodIsDead") == false && $playerroom != 1 && $ball = 0>>
Renata: We should dance.
Renata seems trustworthy.
You follow Renata to the dance floor.
<<elseif visited("GodIsDead") == true && $playerroom != 1>>
Huh?
How did you get on the dancefloor?
<<endif>>
Is it just you or is that disco ball not properly fixed to the rafters?
Renata: Don't move, sweetie.
Renata takes on step to the side.
The disco ball come crashing down.
